LLRB, Left Leaning Red Black, tree a popular data structured with
interesting features like:
* [x] Optimized for in-memory index.
* [x] Self-balancing data structure.
* [x] Read optimized.
* [x] A random successful search examines log2 N âˆ’ 0.5 nodes.
* [x] The average tree height is about 2 * log2 N.
* [x] The average size of left subtree exhibits log-oscillating behavior.

Refer to this [wikipedia link] for more information on LLRB algorithm.

**Compatibility policy**

``llrb-index`` shall officially support the latest version of rust stable
compiler and nightly builds.
